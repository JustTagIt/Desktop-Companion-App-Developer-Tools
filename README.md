# Desktop Companion App Developer Tools

The Desktop Companion Developer Tools let you create desktop apps that work with Magic Leap devices over the [Desktop Companion App](https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/downloads). Full documentation is available at https://developer.magicleap.com/en-us/learn/guides/dca-overview. This GitHub repository contains the MacOS static library (libdcaclient.a) and the Windows static library (libdcaclient.lib). By using them with the headers and ProtoBuf definitions, you can create high performance extensions directly with C. Also provided are the DCA Command-Line Apps (DCACLA) for Mac and Windows, a simple executable wrapper for the dcaclient, which might be more convenient for integration in your app.
